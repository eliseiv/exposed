"""THE two mandatory billing tests.

Both are DIFF-TESTS: each fails against the pre-fix implementation, which is the only thing that
proves they lock anything at all.

* ``test_payments_dedup_vs_grant`` — key the grant on the EVENT id and the balance doubles,
  silently. One purchase = several Adapty events = ONE transaction id.
* ``test_record_and_grant_atomicity`` — commit layer 1 on its own and a crash between the layers
  loses the payment FOREVER (the retry sees "already delivered" and grants nothing).
