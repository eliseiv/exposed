"""The single product catalogue — ``PRODUCTS``.

Replaces the three near-identical maps of the source (``TOKEN_PRODUCTS`` /
``ADAPTY_PRODUCT_TOKENS`` / ``CLOUDPAYMENTS_PRODUCT_TOKENS``) and their three fallback grants.

Two invariants live here:

* **BR-8 (anti-tamper).** ``credits`` from THIS map is the ONLY source of the granted amount.
  Never the client body, never ``payments.amount``, never a "default" constant.
* **Fail-closed.** A product missing from the map — or not allowed in the paying channel by its
  ``channels`` allowlist — grants **0 credits** (``payments.status='rejected'``, WARNING, alert
  ``PaymentRejected``). There is **no** fallback grant in any channel: crediting an amount nobody
  configured is the same BR-8 violation as taking the amount from the callback body.

``GET /v1/products`` serves the catalogue from this very map, so the UI and the grant cannot
drift apart.
