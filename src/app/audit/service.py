"""Append-only audit journal.

Only INSERT — never UPDATE/DELETE from code (DB-level enforcement: TD-001). The payload is
redacted before insert: ``assert_no_secrets()`` is the LAST guard before the
row lands in ``audit_logs``.

**Transactional property (the point of this module):** ``AuditService`` never opens its own
transaction — the CALLER passes its session, so the money action and the record about it commit or
roll back TOGETHER. "Debited but not recorded" and "recorded but not debited" are both impossible
states; audit completeness is a guarantee, not best-effort (unlike logs).
