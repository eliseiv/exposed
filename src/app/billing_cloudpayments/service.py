"""The public RU webhook: callback = TRIGGER, verify = truth.

Order matters, and each step is a defence:

0. **config gate** — no ``CLOUDPAYMENTS_API_TOKEN`` → 500 (we cannot verify ⇒ we must not credit;
   the aggregator retries until the operator configures the channel);
1. **body shape** → ``ignored`` (no DB, no outgoing call);
2. **gate** ``Status=Completed`` + ``OperationType=Payment``;
3. **resolve** the user via the SHARED resolver → miss = ``user_not_found``, WARNING,
   **and NO outgoing verify** — a garbage callback must not make us call the aggregator
   (anti-amplification: the endpoint is public);
4. **verify** through the aggregator API with OUR key — the ONLY trigger of a grant. Transient
   failure → **500 retriable** (never 200: 200 means "accepted" and the payment would be lost);
5. **reconcile** — confirmed status, inside the freshness window;
6. **credit** each payment through ``PaymentsJournal``, keyed by the ``payment_id`` FROM VERIFY.

Why the callback's own ``TransactionId`` is never a key: we do not trust the callback, so its
identifier cannot key money — an attacker "occupying" a TransactionId would otherwise block a real
grant.
