"""The ONE exit point of every billing operation: outcome log + metric.

Every billing operation — webhook, subscription sync, token purchase, checkout — emits **exactly
one** structured outcome record and **exactly one** ``billing_outcome_total`` sample, on **every**
exit path, including the early ones that never reach the ``payments`` journal.

Why this module exists at all: in the source, the reason an event was ignored lived ONLY in the
HTTP body returned to the payment platform. The platform does not show it. Our logs had nothing.
A paying user went a month without access and nobody had a single signal. **An endpoint that
answers 200 on failure MUST log the reason, or its failures do not exist.**

`impact` — the label alerts match on
------------------------------------
An alert must match the INVARIANT ("what does this mean for money"), never a regex over today's
list of reasons: a new reason of the same meaning would silently fall out of the alert.

The classification is not a judgement call — it follows a SYMMETRIC predicate:

* **P1 (against under-estimating).** upstream confirmed money AND 0 credits granted ⇒ money is
  lost ⇒ ``lost_payment`` / ``refund_needed`` (WARNING + page).
* **P2 (against over-estimating).** no money taken AND nothing broken ⇒ no action ⇒ ``none``
  (INFO, never page). P2 matters as much as P1: a noisy reason inside an impact class devalues
  the expensive reason of the same class — after two false pages on a routine
  ``unknown_event_type`` the on-call starts ignoring ``BillingUpstreamFailing``, and with it the
  ``invalid_transaction`` spike that means an expired Apple root CA and paying users getting
  nothing.

`impact` is a function of the **exit path** ``(op, reason)``, not of ``reason`` alone: the same
``unknown_product`` means "Apple already took the money" in ``token_purchase`` (verification
happened one step earlier) ⇒ ``lost_payment``, but "no payment exists yet" in ``checkout`` ⇒
``none``.
